## Learning Objectives

::: callout-note
By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Recognise when the **proportional hazards (PH) assumption** is violated

  - Stratified Cox model
  - Time-varying effects
  - Extended Cox with time-varying covariates
- Understand when a **joint model** is needed
