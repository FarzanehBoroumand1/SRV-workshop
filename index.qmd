title: "Advanced Survival Concepts and Analysis"
---



Welcome!

This workshop covers a series of lectures on **survival analysis**.

We begin with an introduction to **survival data** and basic survival analysis, followed by the **Cox proportional hazards model**. We then explore **extensions of the Cox model** when the proportional hazards assumption is violated, as well as **joint models** and **nonlinear Cox models**.

All lectures are prepared by **Dr Farzaneh Boroumand** (Farzaneh.Boroumand@sydney.edu.au).

The datasets used in this workshop are **simulated datasets**, created solely for **educational purposes**.
